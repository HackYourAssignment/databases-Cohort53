# 3.1 SQL Normalization

## 1. What columns violate 1NF?
- `food_code` and `food_description` columns contain multiple comma-separated values in a one cell and this is violates 1NF, to be presised - atomicity.
- `dinner_date` column has data in inconsistent formats and it is not strictly a 1NF violation but should be normalized for consistency purpose.

## 2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
- member (member_id, member_name, member_address)
- dinner (dinner_id, dinner_date, venue_code)
- venue (venue_code, venue_description)
- food (food_code, food_description)
New tables, that can be created to properly model the relationships in normalized database. They are needed for a good design:
- dinner_food (dinner_id, food_code) — to represent which foods were served at each dinner
- member_dinner (member_id, dinner_id) — to represent which members attended which dinners

## 3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
- members: (member_id PK, member_name, member_address)
- venues: (venue_code PK, venue_description)
- dinners: (dinner_id PK, dinner_date, venue_code FK)
- foods: (food_code PK, food_description)
- dinner_foods: (dinner_id FK, food_code FK, PK(dinner_id, food_code))
- member_dinners: (member_id FK, dinner_id FK, PK(member_id, dinner_id))
